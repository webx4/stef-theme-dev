Post Title Good semantics
We've already talked about the importance of good semantics, and why we should use the right HTML element for the job. This cannot be ignored, as it is one of the main places that accessibility is badly broken if not handled properly.

Out there on the web, the truth is that people do some very strange things with HTML markup. Some abuses of HTML are due to legacy practices that have not been completely forgotten, and some are just plain ignorance. Whatever the case, you should replace such bad code wherever you see it, whenever you can.

Sometimes you are not in the position to get rid of bad markup — your pages might be generated by some kind of server-side framework over which you don't have full control, or you might have third party content on your page (such as ad banners) over which you have no control.

The goal isn't "all or nothing", however — every improvement you are able to make will help the cause of accessibility.
